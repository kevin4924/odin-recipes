        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple, classic comfort food made by grilling slices of cheese
             (often cheddar or American) between two pieces of bread, usually buttered, until the bread is 
             golden brown and crispy and the cheese is melted and gooey.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 sliced white bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shreeded extra sharp cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet 
                over medium-low heat. Place bread slices over hot butter in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on 1 bread slice; place other bread slice, 
                butter-side up, on top of cheese. Spread about 2 tablespoons cheese on top of 
                sandwich.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet next to sandwich. Flip sandwich
                 onto melted butter, cheese-side down. Spread remaining cheese on top of sandwich. 
                 Cook until cheese on the bottom is crispy and caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip 
                 sandwich and cook until cheese is crispy and caramelized on the other side, 3 to 4 
                 minutes more.</li>
